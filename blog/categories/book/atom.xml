    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For B2B high-tech startup, there is a period when the product is already successful in the early market and is trying to enter the mainstream market. This period is called crossing-the-chasm period and it&rsquo;s peril. Many startups die during this period and never reach the mainstream market. This book tells us why there is such a period and why it&rsquo;s dangerous. It also shows how we can get through this period and be successful in the mainstream market.</p>

<h2>Technology Adoption Life Cycle</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post/crossing-the-chasm/technology-adoption-life-cycle.png"></p>

<p>For the technology or product offered by a company, its adoption goes through several phases from left to right.</p>

<h4>Innovators (Technology Enthusiasts)</h4>

<p>This is a group of people who are techies. They just like new technologies for its own sake and are willing to try them. They don&rsquo;t represent a significant market in themselves, nor do they have enough buying power. However they are still important to win over because 1) they are the sounding board and test bed for the new technology or product 2) they are the reference base for early adopters.</p>

<h4>Early Adopters (Visionaries)</h4>

<p>This group of people treat the new technology or product as an opportunity to have a strategic leap forward. They want fundamental breakthrough enabled by the new technology and are willing to take high risks due to the potential order-of-magnitude return on investment. These people have big budget to implement their strategic initiative so they are an important source of high-tech development capital.</p>

<h4>Early Majority (Pragmatists)</h4>

<p>These people represent the mainstream market that any startup wants to win due to its volume. Unlike visionaries, they want incremental, predictable improvements instead of disruptive ones. They have the following characteristics: 1) they are loyal once won and will even help you to defend new comers 2) they want to buy the <em>whole product</em> from the <em>market leader</em> 3) they reference other pragmatists not visionaries.</p>

<h4>Late Majority (Conservatives)</h4>

<p>They buy the extremely mature product with low cost just to stay on par with the rest of the world. They are the low-margin end of the market but have high volume.</p>

<h4>Laggards (Skeptics)</h4>

<p>Even though they may not buy products, they do point continually to the discrepancies between the sales claims and the delivered product. Startups should use their feedbacks to continuously improving the products.</p>

<h2>Word of Mouth</h2>

<p>In the high-tech buying process, word of mouth is the number-one source of information that buyers reference. People reference each other during the buying decision.</p>

<h2>Whole Product</h2>

<p><img src="/images/post/crossing-the-chasm/whole-product.png"></p>

<p>In the mainstream market, people want to buy whole product not core product. In other words, they want to buy the product that has a surrounding ecosystem, which radically reduces their burden of support. Since whole products grow up around the market leading products and not around the others, pragmatists buy from market leaders.</p>

<h2>Chasm</h2>

<p>The chasm between visionaries and pragmatists exists because visionaries is a very poor reference base for pragmatists. They are fundamentally different groups of people for the following reasons: 1) visionaries don&rsquo;t need many references to buy a product, rather they want to be the first to buy the product and create competitive advantage; pragmatists, on the other hand, need extensive reference to prove the validity of the new product 2) visionaries care more about the future, in fact, they are defining the future, while pragmatists don&rsquo;t put a lot of stake in futuristic things 3) visionaries don&rsquo;t expect the existence of the whole product and they are willing to piece together one themselves in return for getting a jump on their competition, while pragmatists only want to buy the whole product 4) visionaries, successful or not, don&rsquo;t plan to stick around long while pragmatists are cautious about their decisions since they know they will have to live with the results. This effectively means that when we try to win over pragmatists, there is effectively no reference base to start with.</p>

<h2>D-Day</h2>

<p>The way to cross the chasm successfully is by launching a D-Day type of invasion focusing on a highly specific target segment within a mainstream marketplace.</p>

<h4>Target the Point of Attack</h4>

<p>The first thing to do is finding the target niche market segment which is also called the beachhead segment. The segment should be <em>big enough to matter, small enough to win and good fit with your crown jewels</em>. Customers in that segment should have compelling reason to buy the product or in other words, feel enough pain. Instead of picking the optimal beachhead to be successful, which is very hard if not impossible, what more important is winning whatever good enough beachhead that&rsquo;s picked.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very important to pick a very specific beachhead to conquer instead of the entire mainstream market when we are crossing the chasm for the following reasons: 1) word-of-mouth has boundaries which is ususally within a market segment so winning over one or two customers in each of five or ten different segments is worse than winning four or five customers in one segment in terms of word-of-mouth effect 2) it&rsquo;s easier to become <em>a big fish in a small pond</em> and achieve market leadership given that pragmatists want to buy from market leaders 3) our scarce resource is only enough to build the whole product for a single niche market.</p>

<h4>Assemble the Invasion Force</h4>

<p>The next thing is creating the ecosystem around our core product, namely the whole product. This often requires bringing in partners and allies needed to make it a reality.</p>

<h4>Define the Battle</h4>

<p>Then we need to create the competition and positioning in order for our product to be <em>easy to buy</em>. Viable competition is important since where there is no competition, there is no market. <em>Market alternatives</em> indicate the existence of the budget dollars to buy our products and <em>product alternatives</em> call out the differentiation. The positioning of our product should be short enough to pass the elevator test so that it can successfully create and occupy a space inside the target customers&#8217; head.</p>

<h4>Launch the Invasion</h4>

<p>Finally we need to select the intended distribution channel and set pricing to give us motivational leverage over that channel.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.jjyao.me/blog/2021/08/29/multipliers-how-the-best-leaders-make-everyone-smarter/"/>
    <updated>2021-08-29T22:07:08-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.jjyao.me/blog/2021/08/29/multipliers-how-the-best-leaders-make-everyone-smarter</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you ask people if they want to be multipliers who make surrounding people better or diminishers who make everyone worse, most people will say that they want to be multipliers. However, in reality, many people are accidental diminishers in some aspects. Being a true multiplier requires a multiplier mindset and certain approaches. This book tells you what multipliers are and how to become one.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Multipliers are leaders who make people better and more capable. They can access and revitalize the intelligence in the people around them. They are <em>genius makers</em> by accessing and multiplying the genius in others. They have a <em>growth mindset</em>, which is a belief that basic qualities like intelligence and ability can be cultivated through effort. In contrast, diminishers drain intelligence and capability out of the people around them.</p>

<h2>Multiplier Mindset</h2>

<p>What people believe affects their behaviors. As a result, we need to have a multiplier mindset first in order to become one. The fundamental assumption a multiplier has is that people are smart. They discover the genius in people by asking &ldquo;how is this person smart?&rdquo;. Multipliers believe that:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>People are smart and will figure things out.</em></li>
<li><em>If I can find someone&rsquo;s genius, I can put them to work.</em></li>
<li><em>People&rsquo;s best thinking must be given, not taken.</em></li>
<li><em>People get smarter by being challenged.</em></li>
<li><em>With enough minds, we can figure it out.</em></li>
</ol>


<h2>Challenger vs Know-it-all</h2>

<p>Since multipliers believe that people get smarter by being challenged, they ask really insightful and interesting questions that make people think. They don&rsquo;t limit the team to what they know, they push their teams beyond their own knowledge and that of the organization. Even if they have the answer, the don&rsquo;t just give them. Instead, they just provide enough information to provoke thinking and to help people discover and see the opportunity for themselves. <em>What&rsquo;s more important as a leader is not having the right answer but asking the right questions.</em></p>

<h2>Debate Maker vs Decision Maker</h2>

<p>Multipliers believe that with enough minds, we can figure it out. As a result, they like <em>collective debate</em>. Through debate, they challenge and stretch what people know, thus making the organization smarter over time and creating the organizational will to execute the decisions made. In contrast, when people execute an undebated decision, they turn to debating the soundness of a decision rather than executing it.</p>

<h2>Liberator vs Tyrant</h2>

<p>Multipliers believe that people&rsquo;s best thinking must be given, not taken. They provide a safe environment for people to think and make mistakes. The highest quality of thinking cannot emerge without learning and learning can&rsquo;t happen without mistakes. <em>Intimidation and fear rarely produce truly great work.</em> Speaking of creating a safe environment, there is no easier way to invite experimentation and learning than to <em>share stories about multipliers&#8217; own mistakes</em>.</p>

<p>While multiplier gives space and safe environment, they also demand the best work. It&rsquo;s a fair trade. They create an intense environment that requires people&rsquo;s best thinking and their best work. They generate pressue, but they don&rsquo;t generate stress. Requiring people&rsquo;s best work is different from insisting on desired outcomes. Stress is created when people are expected to produce outcomes that are beyond their control. But they feel positive pressure when they are held to their best work. <em>Multipliers distinguish best work from outcomes.</em></p>

<h2>Investor vs Micro-manager</h2>

<p>Multipliers believe that people are smart and will figure things out. So they operate as investors, giving ownership that keeps rolling back to other people. As investors, they define ownership, invest resources and hold people <em>accountable</em>. When they teach, they invest in their people&rsquo;s ability to solve and avoid problems in the future. In the end, multipliers enable others to operate independently by giving other people ownership for results and investing in their success. They create organizations that can perform and win, not only without them on the field, but long after their direct influence is felt.</p>

<h2>Talent Magnet vs Empire Builder</h2>

<p>Multipliers believe that if I can find someone&rsquo;s genius, I can put them to work. They are like magnets that draw in talent and develop it to its fullset. They look for talent everywhere, find people&rsquo;s <em>native genius</em>, utilize people at their fullsets and remove the blockers. Multipliers not only notice people&rsquo;s talent, they <em>label</em> it for them. By telling people what they see, they raise people&rsquo;s awareness and confidence, allowing them to provide their capability more fully. What&rsquo;s more, once they uncover the native genius of others, they look for opportunities that demand that capability.</p>

<h2><a id="immigration"></a>移民</h2>

<p>这本书分析了两类移民对当地人的影响，分别是低技能移民（low-skilled immigrants）和高技能移民（high-skilled immigrants）。</p>

<p>很多人认为低技能的移民会伤害到低技能的当地人的利益：工资会降低，工作机会会被抢走。<strong><em>然而研究表明低技能的移民并不会降低当地人的工资和就业率</em></strong>。移民增加了劳动力的供应的同时也增加了劳动力的需求 （One very big problem with the supply-demand analysis applied to immigration is that an influx of migrants increases the demand for labor at the same time it increases the supply of laborers.）。一个原因是低技能的移民会在当地生活消费，从而产生了新的需求，因而创造出更多的工作岗位。比如移民的增加，使得管理者需求增加而本地人因为语言等的优势更容易获得这些岗位。另一个原因是廉价的移民劳动力会延缓机器化自动化的发生。另外低技能移民很多做的都是当地人不想干的活，因此并没有真正从当地人手中抢走任何工作。同时作者认为当地人并不一定会在和移民的竞争中落入下风。相对于一个新来的陌生移民，当地人有着自身的优势，比如语言的优势，老板知根知底的优势。</p>

<p>对于高技能移民，作者认为对当地人的影响是两面的。好的方面是高技能移民能提供廉价的高技能服务比如看病，而这可以使当地的低收入人群受益。不好的方面是当地拥有同等技能的人会面临着更激烈的竞争。</p>

<h2><a id="globalization"></a>全球化</h2>

<p>全球化和自由贸易可以使得每个国家做自己拥有比较优势（comparative advantage）的活，以此提高生产效率（productivity）。这个世界作为一个整体因此受益，而收益的再分配可以让每个人享受到全球化的成果。而为了达到效率的最大化，资源（比如资本和劳动力）需要能够自由流通到需要它们的地方。然而本书却提出了资源往往具有粘性（resources tend to be sticky）的观点，也就是说资源往往到不了最需要它们的地方。比如出于不确定性，人们更愿意留在家乡而不是到更需要劳动力的城市和国家。</p>

<p>同时作者分析了全球化和自由贸易对于发达国家和发展中国家的影响。发达国家的优势是资本而发展中国家的优势是廉价劳动力，因此全球化会使发达国家的资本家受益而发展中国家的工人受益。另一方面，发达国家资本家受益的同时，它们的工人会在和发展中国家廉价劳动力竞争中受损（Workers were likely to suffer from trade in rich countries and benefit from it in poor countries.）。为了帮助受影响的发达国家工人，国家需要进行收入再分配和各类政策扶持。而贸易战却不是解决这个问题的方法之一，它帮助了某些人的同时也会伤害到另外一些人（While trade war may save some jobs in steal, it would likely cause significant new damage to others. The US economy will be fine. Hundreds of thousands of people will not.）。</p>

<h2><a id="prejudice"></a>偏见</h2>

<p>本书提到了现在社会充满了对立，分裂和偏见的现象（比如民主党vs共和党，白人vs黑人）。作者认为现在的社交网络非但没有缓解这些现象，反而作为一个回声室（echo chamber），恶化了它们。作者还认为人们的对立和偏见背后有着深层次的原因（比如对世界的不满，感到没有被世界尊重）。打击偏见的方法不应该是直接和他们就此争论或者表现出对他们的鄙视，这样做只会加深偏见（Preferences like prejudice are as much part of the symptoms of the malaise as its cause, perhaps more. Prejudice is often a defensive reaction to the many things we feel are going wrong in the world, our economic travails, and a sense that we are no longer respected or valued.）。为了缓解这些现象，作者认为一个有效的方式是多接触，多互相了解。而学校在这一方面扮演了非常重要的角色。不同背景的年轻人生活学习在一起，可以消除偏见达到互信（Familiarity performed its magic.）。而这也是像哈佛这样培养未来领导人的学校需要招收各个族群学生的一个原因，过多的偏向某一个族群会产生不好的影响（As a flagship producer of the next generation of leaders, Harvard clearly needs to find a place for students from all social groups, and a massive overrepresentation of any particular social group relative to its weight in the population is both perhaps undesirable in a democracy and likely to lead to political problems.）。</p>

<h2><a id="growth"></a>经济增长</h2>

<p>本书的一个重要观点是<strong><em>人们目前还不知道持久经济增长的内在机制是什么</em></strong>，包括如何恢复增长和保持增长（Despite the best efforts of generations of economists, the deep mechanisms of persistent economic growth remain elusive.）。与此相关的是给富人减税并不会促进经济的增长（Tax cuts for the wealthy do not produce economic growth.）。另一方面，尽管无法带来持续的经济增长，但提高资源利用率，减少资源的错误分配还是能让贫穷国家获得一定的增长，而这需要克服之前提到的资源粘性问题。最后虽然没人知道如何持续不断的增长经济，但所有国家都能致力于改善国民的福祉，即使它们不能被反映在GDP上（GDP values only those things priced and marketed.）。</p>

<h2><a id="climate"></a>气候变暖</h2>

<p>气候变暖是个全球性的问题，然而它却非常不公平。很大一部分的碳排放都是发达国家导致的（直接排放或者消费发展中国家生产的商品），然而全球变暖的大部分代价却是由发展中国家来承受。因此作者认为发达国家需要为气候变暖承担很大一部分责任。作者还认为人们的消费习惯是可以被改变的，可以变得更低碳更环保。通过税的引导，政府可以慢慢改变人们不环保的消费习惯。</p>

<h2><a id="inequality"></a>贫富差距</h2>

<p>日益扩大的贫富差距也是本书的一个重点讨论议题。作者认为美国这几十年的贫富差距是人为的政策导致的而不是不可控的技术革新（The last thirty years of US history should convince us that the evolution of inequality is not the by-product of technological changes we do not control: it is the result of policy decisions.）。</p>

<p>首先作者认为先富带动后富并没有真正在美国发生，相反富人的财富得到了极大的增长，而穷人的工资涨幅却没有跟上GDP的涨幅，结果就是社会的财富越来越集中到少数富人手中。其中一个重要原因是富人的低税收。低税收使得高工资对CEO们更有吸引力（因为大部分工资都会变成税后工资）而公司之间对优秀CEO的争夺也相应拉高了工资。另外现在CEO主要的收入来自股票而不是基本工资，这也就使得他们对涨工资动力不大，反而会想要降低工资来削减成本从而提升股价（Linking managerial pay to the stock market meant that manager’s pay was no longer linked to a salary scale within the enterprise. When everyone was on the same scale, CEOs had to grow salaries at the bottom to increase their own. With stock options, they had no reason to increase wages at the bottom, and in fact every reason to squeeze costs.）。作者提倡对富人收取高额的税收，并且没有证据表明这样做会降低富人的工作积极性（All in all, therefore, it seems to us that high marginal income tax rates, applied only to very high incomes, are a perfectly sensible way to limit the explosion of top income inequality. They would not be extortionary, since very few people will end up paying them; top mangers will simply not get these kinds of income anymore. And from all we see, they won’t discourage anybody to work as hard as they can.）。另外作者也意识到征收富人税会面临极大的困难。一方面富人有足够的资源对政客进行游说，另一方面富人可以将财富转移到低税收国家进行避税，而国家之间对于这些财富的竞争会使得税率变低（This gives rise to a race to the bottom on tax rates.）。归根到底征收富人税并不是一个经济问题，而是个政治问题（The difficulty of raising top tax rates is a political one.）。</p>

<p>在富人越来越富的同时，美国的穷人却遇到了收入停滞和阶级固化的问题。由此他们会产生绝望或愤怒，绝望的人把问题归咎于自身而愤怒的人把问题归咎于别人（The majority of Americans whose wages and income have stagnated, and who confront an ever-widening gap between the wealth they see around them and the financial woes they are experiencing, face a choice between blaming themselves for not benefitting from the opportunities they believe their society offers and finding someone to blame for stealing their jobs. That way lies despair and anger.）。而这两种情绪对个人和社会都没有益处，绝望的人失去了希望而愤怒的人把问题错误地归咎于移民和全球化（Behind the anti-immigrant views, are two misconceptions: an exaggeration of how many migrants are coming in, or about to come in, and a belief in the nonfact that low-skilled immigrants depress wages.）。作者认为政府需要出台政策来帮助那些受全球化和自由贸易影响的人，其中一个方法就是UBI（universal basic income）。不像别的救助项目，UBI没有任何门槛（比如没有复杂的申请和审核流程）因此可以保证最需要帮助的人能够享受到。另外没有证据显示穷人会因此降低工作积极性或者乱花钱（There is no support in the data for the view that the poor just blow the money on desires rather than needs.）。相反地，这些钱能让穷人少了后顾之忧，让他们有更多的精力放在工作之上，让他们更可能离开家乡去寻找更多的工作机会。在有着这些优势的情况下，实施UBI最大的困难就是政府没有足够的钱。</p>

<p>最后作者充满人文关怀地提到对于穷人的帮助需要照顾他们的尊严，要把他们当作人来对待。他们可能有问题，但他们不是问题本身（While they may have problems, they are not the problem. They are entitled to be seen for who they are and to not be defined by the difficulties besieging them.）。</p>
